Hey! I'm a comp bio postdoc who is interested in topics such as:
* linguistics
* food
* geospatial data

This blog is my attempt to further develop my data science skills by combining facets of all 3 into a single analysis. In otherwords, it's a place for me to procrastinate on the job I'm paid to do :)
